<p align="center">Automatic Speech Recognition System</p>

ASR Systems try to map each signal input to the corresponding text. The architecture of ASR Systems typically includes Feature Extractor, Acoustic Model (Encoder) and Decoder. In many situations, Language Model might be used to improve prediction accuracy. After being extracted by Feature Extractor, data are encoded by the Encoder and decoded by the Decoder to produce the text.

### Emotion recognition
#### Image
The problem of emotion recognition is a large area of research based on two subjects, which are emotional psychology and artificial intelligence. Human's emotions can be expressed through speech or nonverbal such as facial variations, tone of voice, etc and are recognized by sensor. In 1967, Mehrabian showed that 55% of emotions expressed from the face, 38% from the words voice and 7% from speech. That is why researchers are very interested in this field.  

Facial emotion recognition has many applications in variety of fields: 
- Education: learner's reactions to participating in the lesson.
- Examination: monitor and make predictions whenever contestants show signs of cheating.
- Marketing: how to receive information from buyers when listening about product offers.
- Security: helps detect suspicious behavior in the crowd and prevent threats potential opportunity.
- Medical: automate the care process and analyzing the mental health of users.
- Recruitment: evalutate candidate quality and interview process.

</p>

#### Video
Traditionally, facial emotion recognition has relied heavily on static images. However, in dynamic contexts such as videos, understanding temporal dynamics becomes crucial for accurate emotion interpretation. One approach to addressing this involves focusing on the most relevant frames within a video, rather than uniformly sampling frames. This is achieved by calculating a distribution for the importance of frames based on an attention mechanism, facilitating more efficient sampling and analysis.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/research/fer-overall_resample_frame.png" width="90%" 
  title="Image Captioning">
</p>

In overview, the model is divided into 2 stages:

Stage 1: The model will generate an attention weight to measure the correlation between frames. Then, a new distribution will be calculated based on this matrix, allowing for more suitable sampling of new frames.


Stage 2: The model will take in the new frame samples and provide the primary prediction results.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/research/fer-overall_resample_model.png" width="90%" 
  title="Image Captioning">
</p>

Usage:

1. Frame Sampling: Frames are sampled uniformly from the distribution of original video frames.
2. Feature Extraction: A ResNet backbone is employed to extract features from each sampled frame. This step ensures that relevant information is captured from the frames.
3. Incorporation of Attention Mechanism within Frames: Due to global connectivity limitations, an attention block is introduced. This attention mechanism enhances feature correlation within individual frames.
4. Global Average Pooling (GAP) and Tokenization: Global Average Pooling (GAP) is applied along the spatial dimension. Each frame is collapsed into a single token, which acts as input for subsequent blocks.
5. Temporal Attention Mechanism: Besides typical transformer block outputs, this block generates an attention weight. The attention weight matrix stores the correlation between frames, capturing temporal relationships.
6. Calculation of New Distribution: Utilizing the correlation matrix, a new distribution is computed. This distribution guides the resampling of frames for enhanced temporal understanding.
7. Resampling Frames: Frames are resampled based on the updated distribution. This step ensures that the model captures temporal correlations effectively.
8. Prediction Using Resampled Frames: Primary predictions are made based on the resampled frames.


This multi-stage approach not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of emotion recognition systems but also renders them indispensable tools across a multitude of fields and applications.

### Object Detection for the Visually Impaired

Vision is an essential aspect of human life, providing us with the ability to perceive and interact with the world around us. However, visual impairment is a prevalent global issue, affecting a significant proportion of the population. Living with visual impairment poses significant challenges for individuals when it comes to independently navigating their surroundings, both indoors and outdoors.

The objective of this project is to design and deploy an object detection device to assist individuals with visual impairments in their daily lives. This system applies computer vision techniques and image processing to help individuals recognize and locate objects in their surrounding environment. The core components of the system comprise an Intel depth camera, a processor such as a single-board computer/laptop, a microphone, and a headphone. These hardware components work in synergy to enable real-time object detection, obstacle avoidance, and virtual assistant functionalities.
